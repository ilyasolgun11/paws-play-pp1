# Paw's Play

## Site Overview <a name="site-overview"></a>

The Paw's Play website is a service for people who want a trusted daycare for their dogs, with eligibility criteria that separate it from the competition by only housing dogs that won't endanger dogs under its care.
The users of this website will be able to find all relevant information about the daycare; for example an eligibility form, contact information and about Paw's Play.

## Color Scheme: <a name="color-scheme"></a>

When deciding on the color scheme, I decided I should go with colors matching the illustrations I got from [icons8](https://icons8.com/illustrations/animal/dog/technique--3d) i selected a pink-ish color to compliment the illustration perfectly and used the color [grader site](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFF%2C%20%0D%0A%23d298aa%0D%0A%23d56589%2C%0D%0A%23a7244e%2C%20%0D%0A%23131313%2C%20%0D%0A%2300000%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast scores, using the grid showed me which background colors match with which text color so the site is accessible to everyone.

## Future-Enhancements <a name="future-enhancements"></a>

- The future intentions of this website will be a landing page for anyone looking for a dog daycare in the north London area. The functionality I want to add in the future is a database where the user's eligibility submissions could go, with the data Paw's Play obtains we can easily know everything that we need to know to follow up with customers who are interested in our services.
- Once I learn JavaScript I would love to add a sign-up page where users can join the Paw's Play community.
- I would also love to make a Paw's Play app where owners can see their dog's day-to-day achievements regarding new tricks and new commands they have learned; Also a section where they can see a live broadcast of the main hall where the dogs are kept so they can see what their pooch is doing whenever they want.

## Testing Phase <a name="testing-phase"></a>

I have moved the details for the testing of the Paw's Play site to [Testing.md](./TESTING.md)

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

I deployed the site on GitGub using the following procedure:

1. Once on the project's repository, I clicked on the _settings_ tab.
2. Then select the _Pages_ tab.
3. Then under the _Source_ section, I selected the _Main_ branch from the dropdown menu and clicked _Save_.
4. After a few minutes, the page was deployed.
