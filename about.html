          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Our founders, <span>Grace Shelby</span> and
            <span>Thomas Shelby</span>, established Paws Play in
            <span>2001</span> with a deep love for dogs at its core. They
            envisioned a haven where dogs could play, socialize, and receive
            attentive care. Driven by their
            <span>passion for our furry friends</span>, Paws Play became a
            <span>trusted dog daycare</span> providing a
            <span>safe and enjoyable environment</span> for dogs while their
            owners are at work or away. Grace and Thomas' commitment to ensuring
            a happy and nurturing space for every dog has made
            <span>Paws Play a beloved destination for canine companions</span>
            seeking quality care and fun-filled days.
